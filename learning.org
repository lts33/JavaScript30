* Q1
** script might ran before page finished loading
i tried to seperated Javascript out of the html file. it seems not working at the begining. script can not find any ~key~ class which is weird. then i found out the location of script src tag would load the script at that point. possible solutions:
*** Load Script after Body
which works for me
*** Check Dom load event ( based on [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35520531/javascript-is-not-working-outside-the-html-document][discussion]] in Stack Overflow )
** some methods for ~querySelector~
I guess jQuery or React might have more convient solutions
Example to select specific attribute
#+begin_src javascript

const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);

#+end_src
